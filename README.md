This command would be useful in such case.

Search opened tabs and focus, close them.

### ch browser

Switch browsers with ease.

This command also requires you to change the browser profile.

### ch profile

Switch profiles with ease.

### ch cache

Cache favicon images from your visit history in advance.

You don't need this command since caching runs automatically every three days in background.

## 🔖 Options

Configure below options through Workflow Environment Variables.

You can switch your profile through `ch profile` with `Profile {number}`, `Default` and these values.

Each profile name should be splited with comma (`,`).

## 🌟 Contribution

Contributions of any kind are welcome.

### Add supporting new browser

This workflow needs your help to support as many browsers as possible.

To add new browser, follow below guideline.

1. Check the browser is based on `Chromium`.
2. Add new path to `GetProfileRootPath` in `src/utils.go`.
3. Add the browser's proper Application Name to `getApplicationName` in `src/tabManager.go`. You can check this value through Applescript Editor's Dictionary.
4. Add proper `Open URL` block of `info.plist` using Alfred.
5. Add new browser's item `SelectBrowser` in `src/config.go`.
6. Add the browser name to `READMD.md`.
7. Add the browser's icon to `assets/browser-icons`.
