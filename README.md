## ðŸŒŸ Contribution

Contributions of any kind are welcome.

### Add supporting new browser

This workflow needs help to support as many browsers as possible.

To add new browser, please follow below guideline.

1. Check the browser is based on `Chromium`.
2. Add new path to `GetProfileRootPath` in `src/utils.go`.
3. Add the browser's proper Application Name to `getApplicationName` in `src/tabManager.go`. You can check this value through Applescript Editor's Dictionary.
4. Add proper `Open URL` block of `info.plist` using Alfred.
5. Add new browser's item `SelectBrowser` in `src/config.go`.
6. Add the browser name to `READMD.md`.
7. Add the browser's icon to `assets/browser-icons`.
